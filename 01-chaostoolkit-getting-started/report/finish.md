Congratulations! You've seen how you can use the `chaos report` command to turn the output of your chaos experiments into great looking reports for everyone to learn from. 

The `chaos report` command closes the `discover`->`init`->`run`->`report` workflow that is at the heart of the [Chaos Toolkit](http://chaostoolkit.org/).
