Running an experiment is helpful for immediate learning, but usually you'll want to share the outcomes of your experiments so your whole team, and maybe even your company at large, can learn from your experiments too. After all, organisational learning is a big goal of Chaos Engineering!

The [Chaos Toolkit](http://chaostoolkit.org/) comes with a `chaos report` command for just this purpose. It turns your experiments into reports in various formats so everyone can learn from your chaos efforts.
