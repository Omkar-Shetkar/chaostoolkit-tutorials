The [Chaos Toolkit](http://chaostoolkit.org/) is a free, open source project
that enables you to create and apply 
[Chaos Experiments](https://docs.chaostoolkit.org/reference/concepts/#experiments) to discover, and
eventually improve and address, weaknesses across your system's infrastructure, 
platform and application levels.

This tutorial takes you through the setup of the Chaos Toolkit's `chaos` 
command. It also teaches you how [Chaos Toolkit Extensions](https://chaostoolkit.org/extensions) can be used to select which layers and 
technologies can be targetted by your experiments when added into your 
Chaos Toolkit environment.
