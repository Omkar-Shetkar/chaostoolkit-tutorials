The [Chaos Toolkit](http://chaostoolkit.org/) is a free, open source project
that enables you to create and apply 
[Chaos Experiments](http://chaostoolkit.org/overview/concepts/) to discover, and
eventually improve and address, weaknesses across your system's infrastructure, 
platform and application levels.

This tutorial takes you through the setup of the Chaos Toolkit's `chaos` 
command. It also teaches you how [Chaos Toolkit Extensions](http://chaostoolkit.org/extending/approaches/), that select which layers and 
technologies can be targetted by your experiments, can be installed into your 
environment.
