You have now seen how to use the `chaos discover` and `chaos init` commands to explore what you might like to do with the probes and actions on your target environment and used that information to simply and easily create a chaos engineering experiment.

By using `chaos discover` and `chaos init` you can now create a catalogue of experiments to explore all your system's weaknesses and build confidence in those weaknesses being addressed by running your new automated chaos experiments continuously.
