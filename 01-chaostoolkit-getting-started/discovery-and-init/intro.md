While you _can_ write your experiments from scratch, it is the mission of the [Chaos Toolkit](http://chaostoolkit.org/) to make it as easy _and quick_ as possible to create your own experiments and so the toolkit also comes with a `chaos discover` command.

Rather than startiong from a blank slate, the `chaos discover` command can help you to explore your current target environment to see what can be acted upon or probed in your chaos engineering experiments. 

In this scenario you will learn how to use the
