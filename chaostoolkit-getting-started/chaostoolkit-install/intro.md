The [Chaos Toolkit](http://chaostoolkit.org/) is a free, open source project
that enables you to create and apply Chaos Experiments to various types of
infrastructure, platforms and applications.

This training will take you through the setup of a Python environment deployed
with the `chaos` command. It will also teach you how extensions are installed
in that environment.
